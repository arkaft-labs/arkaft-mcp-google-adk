# Arkaft Google ADK MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server built in Rust that serves as an expert system for Google ADK (Application Development Kit) documentation. The server provides comprehensive knowledge of Google ADK documentation, ensures access to the latest versions, promotes best practices, and offers file translation capabilities with architectural guidance.

## Overview

This MCP acts as an intelligent assistant for developers working with Google ADK, offering:

- **Documentation Expertise**: Comprehensive knowledge of Google ADK documentation with version awareness and official references
- **Best Practices Enforcement**: Promotes and enforces official Google ADK best practices and architectural patterns
- **Rust Code Review**: Analysis of .rs files for translation needs, ADK compliance, and architectural improvements
- **Architecture Validation**: Validation of proposed implementations against established ADK guidelines

## Features

### MCP Tools

- `adk_query` - Query Google ADK documentation and concepts with current version awareness
- `review_rust_file` - Review Rust files for translation needs, ADK compliance, and architectural improvements  
- `validate_architecture` - Validate architectural patterns against official Google ADK best practices
- `get_best_practices` - Get official Google ADK best practices for specific scenarios

### Documentation References

The server provides accurate information based on official Google ADK documentation:

- [Google ADK Quickstart Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/) and related official sources
- Always references the most current version of Google ADK documentation
- Clarifies version-specific features and compatibility
- Implementation examples using current ADK version syntax and patterns

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo package manager

### Building from Source

```bash
cd arkaft-mcp-google-adk
cargo build --release
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Run in development mode
cargo run

# Run the release build
./target/release/arkaft-mcp-google-adk
```

## Usage

### With MCP-Compatible Tools

Configure your MCP client to connect to this server. The server implements the standard MCP protocol and can be used with any compatible IDE or development tool.

### With Kiro IDE Agent System

This MCP server is designed to integrate seamlessly with the **Arkaft ADK Agents** system in Kiro IDE, providing:

- **Automated Code Review**: Agents that automatically review Rust files using the `review_rust_file` tool
- **Architecture Validation**: Real-time validation of ADK patterns using `validate_architecture`
- **Documentation Assistance**: Context-aware help using the `adk_query` tool
- **Best Practices Enforcement**: Automated guidance using `get_best_practices`

For setup instructions with Kiro agents, see the [ADK Agents Specification](../.kiro/specs/arkaft-adk-agents/).

## Integration with Kiro ADK Agents

This MCP server serves as the knowledge backend for the **Arkaft ADK Agents** system, a comprehensive agent framework that provides intelligent development assistance for Google ADK projects in Kiro IDE.

### Agent System Features

The agent system leverages this MCP server to provide:

- **Automated Workflows**: Hooks that trigger on file saves, component creation, and other development activities
- **Specialized Agents**: Different agents for code review, architecture validation, documentation, and project assistance
- **Real-time Guidance**: Immediate feedback and suggestions based on ADK best practices
- **Seamless Integration**: Works transparently with your existing development workflow

### MCP Configuration for Agents

To use this server with the ADK agents, configure it in your Kiro MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arkaft-google-adk": {
      "command": "./arkaft-mcp-google-adk/target/release/arkaft-mcp-google-adk",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "RUST_LOG": "info",
        "ADK_DOCS_VERSION": "latest"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": ["adk_query", "review_rust_file", "validate_architecture", "get_best_practices"]
    }
  }
}
```
